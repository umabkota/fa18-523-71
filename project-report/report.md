In 2006, Taiwan saw credit card debt crisis, the banks of Taiwan over issued credit cards in pursuit of
increasing their market share. Also, many cardholders consumed more than their capacity thereby
accumulating heavy debts. Utilizing this data, we aim to classify the defaulters by performing
different statistical analyses, to help predict an individual customer’s credit risk. We believe this
analysis will help us better understand the route cause behind defaulting and also provide a better
way to classify an applicant given his data.We’ll be working on different modelling techniques like
k means, logistic regression, naive Bayes and artificial neural networks to get provide our solution.

### Data
  
The Default of credit card clients is multivariate Data Set from UCI machine learning Repository.It
consists of 30,000 records with 23 features. The features includes amount of given credit, Sex,
Education, Marital status, Age, History of past payments, amount of bill statements, amount paid.

### Questions

* what is the best evaluation metric for the models and it’s precision, recall or specificity and
sensitivity.
* Which is the best model to predict the defaulters.
* Which features influence most to the default payments.
* How this can help to minimize bank’s risk.
* We will analyze data to answer more questions.

### Timeline

* Data Pre-processing – we will be using python for this
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data modelling
  * k-means
  * Logistic Regression
  * Naive Bayes
  * Artificial Neural Network
* Modelling Analysis
* Evaluation and Conclusion
