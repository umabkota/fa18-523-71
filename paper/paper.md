### Abstract

The Internet of things (IoT) is one of the most evolving technology out there today and it is all about ubiquitous computing. Almost all the industries today are using sensors to diagnose the performance of their systems, this data is being used to understand the maintenance, repair issues of machines and in bettering the output produced by them. With the humungous growth of such systems not only in factories and machinery but also in daily walks of life, the data generated is growing exponentially. With such huge data handling, Big data infrastructure plays a pivotal role in running and functioning of IoT.

### Introduction

Internet has been around for a while, but it’s been mostly the product of the people so all the things on the internet such as games, social media, images, and movies all of that are created by people and for the people and about the people. Internet is one of the most creative and transformative things invented. It has changed the way humans go about their lives a great deal. Its woven into the lives of all of us in one or the other way. It is connecting people all around the globe. There is this new emerging and it will change world again. The new internet is not just connecting people, but it is about connecting things. And hence, it is named Internet of Things (IoT).

Today’s bigdata world, Internet of things (IoT) is gaining more and more attention. With increase in digital connection between the physical objects and the internet, data generation rate has rapidly increased in the past few years which has opened the doors for the analysis of big data with the help of big data technologies. IoT allows every device to connect to each other, with electronics devices, software’s, and sensors which exchange continuous streams of data without any human interaction on the IoT platform. These features of IoT allow us to analyze collected data and use it for Business Intelligence. Also, it can be useful to generate various models that can improve daily routine experience of the users. By 2020, Gartner has expected the IoT to connect over 20.4 billion things together ranging from mobile devices, vehicles, robots, and various industrial equipment’s [@fa18-523-59-www-iot-gartner].

The huge amount of data generated by the IoT platform is just not enough to get going. It needs to be handled, processed, managed, integrated, analyzed with big data technology available with us, in a scalable, cost-effective way and more importantly in real time. Hence, the digital world networks of physical object network and big data technologies can collaboratively be used to achieve complex tasks in the field of health care, manufacturing Industries, energy conservation, home automation, transportation system, education and research to improve quality of life.

### Architecture:

The interaction between digital mediums require special architecture and there are many architectures for IoT. The most common IoT Ecosystem architecture is as shown in the figure 1. It consists of seven different layers [@fa18-523-59-www-iot-architecture].

![](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/fa18-523-71/blob/master/paper/images/IoT%20Architecture.png)


- Physical Devices and controllers:
The lowest layer of the Internet of Things (IoT) architecture is the physical devices and controllers which consists of electronic gadgets, sensors and activators which are used to take data input from various sources.

- 	Connectivity:
The next layer we have in the Internet of Thing (IoT) architecture is the Connectivity layer which takes care of the communication between sensors and processing units that try converting the data into an understandable format with the help of certain protocol and perform selection on the data that is to be processed further into the IoT architecture creating thresholds for the incoming data.

- 	Edge computing
Edge Computing does the analysis of Data Elements and their transformation This is achieved by analyzing and filtering the data before it is processed further thereby reducing huge computing and networking costs. The incoming raw data from the sensors and activators can be selectively sent for further analysis. Also, one of the major concerns of Internet of Things (IoT) architecture which is Data Security. Edge computing overcomes this to a considerable extent by keeping some of the sensitive data into the sensor devices. Also, there are devices known as edge devices coming into existence which will help in the analytics and compute purposes delivering the data deliverables at a much faster speed in a robust manner. Not only this, but these edge devices will help in the connectivity with the connected devices at the source thereby allowing us to have a luxury of new smart devices.

-  Data Accumulation:
Data Accumulation is largely done in distributed frameworks as the incoming data is of huge volumes and variety and travelling at a great velocity. Data is distributed into small sets of data using the key/pair values just as in the case of data tuples, mapped and then reduced to small chunks of data before processing it further. Also, these days, organizations are trying to use PaaS (Platform as a Service) as a cloud platform for hosting data publicly and at the same time, securely, thus customizing it to their needs.

- 	Data Abstraction:
Different translation rules are brought into place for the connectivity of specific devices. Also, a single model for data abstraction is created and provided to all the devices of a same service thereby achieving integration of various devices.

- 	Application
The Application layer consists of the reporting and analytics part of the architecture. All the efforts that were put into the data accumulation, abstraction, storage, transformation, cleansing, preparing smaller chunks will be benefited only if proper analytics is performed and strategic Business Intelligence reports are generated out of this data.

- 	Collaboration and processes:
Collaboration and processes layer is the User Interface layer where the people i.e. the end users and the business processes come into picture. In the end, it is the customer for whom engages with the business processes and hence both are brought on the same page and hence the name Collaboration and processes layer.

### Big Data and IoT Together:

Big Data analytics analyzes the data sourced from the Internet of Things (IoT) which does nothing but gets multiple devices connected to it. These devices can be sensors, activators, websites, social media etc. Internet of Things (IoT) has had its advancements and applications in the field of automobiles industries, healthcare, transportation & logistics educational organizations, commercialized residences etc. The incoming data from these domains is of the order of billions of gigabytes per day and at the same time it is largely diversified. Also, the velocity of the inward data flow is extremely high. The Big Data platform then takes this data as the input and stores it into files. Since the data is unstructured, the frameworks used to store the data in the intermediate place are largely distributed. Different big data tools used for storing this huge data are Apache Hadoop, Apache Hive and many more. One of the prominent ones used in the industry is the Hadoop Architecture which has Hadoop Distributed File System and MapReduce as its two components to process the data into small chunks further for the report generations and analysis purpose. The data is in a way captured, integrated, mapped into different data sets of tuples and then processed to the warehouses for storage. The Data warehouses help store the legacy data into them and allow generating reports on the desired data at any given point in time[@ fa18-523-59-www-iot-bigdataanalytics].

Big data is nothing but analysis of some sort of unstructured or semi-structured data to draw Inferences and get insights as to how a particular business is trending. Billions of devices are expected to be connected to the internet and hence for the functionalities of these devices to be held, you need data.  IoT acts a major data source for the data that is to be analyzed by the companies. Where the big data and the IOT together come into picture when data from different connected devices is to be analyzed for decision making. The process of IoT with Big Data is as under [@fa18-523-59-www-iot-iotandbigdata].

- Data, which is sourced from various connected devices or from disparate data repositories is collected and stored in some big data platform. Velocity, Volume and the Variety are the three factors on which the incoming data is largely dependent as this is the real-time data and hence the big data and IoT together is nothing but real-time processing of data.

- The big data system is often referred to as a distributed database as the incoming data is sourced from different data repositories and is then stored in the form of flat files in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) in case of a Hadoop big data platform. Another big component of the Hadoop platform is the Hadoop MapReduce which is used to process independent data chunks efficiently. The Hadoop MapReduce framework works on a MapReduce algorithm where data in the form of files is converted into a data set using key/value pairs just like the dictionaries and tuples. The output of a Map is then given as input to the Reduce stage where different data sets of tuples are converted into small chunks of data in order to be processed further.

- Reports are then generated from this data taking data from the concerned data warehouses using the Business Intelligence Report generation tools as per the client/user specifications. The same is accomplished through complex query writing into the databases. And hence it is the big data platform that paves way for this disparate data collected from different ‘collected devices’ using the Internet of Things (IoT) to be useful enough to derive different business trends and business insights.

### Impacts of IOT on Big data:

The Internet of Things (IoT) has impacted the Big data platform a great deal already and there is going to be a significant impact which lies ahead as well. The only reason we say this is because of the huge volumes of data that is brought in by the devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT). The fact of the matter is that there are going to be more and more devices connected to the IoT invariably making it difficult for the data collection and analytics platform to effectively and efficiently keep producing results [@fa18-523-59-www-iot-futureofiot], [@fa18-523-59-www-iot-howbigdatapoweriot].

- Big Data Storage: 
With data being sourced from various disparate data sources and connected devices as is the case working with Internet of Things (IoT), the data storage platforms need to be very flexible as the incoming data is of the order of billions of terabytes. Also, the rate at which the data is input to the data storage platform is unlike the natural data speed. The incoming data with such great speed is hence balanced a great deal with the help of the three V’s (Velocity, Volume and Variety) stored in the big data platform. One of the main advantages the companies seek nowadays is hosting data in cloud systems so that the data is kept publicly secure and also as per the company requirements. PaaS (Platform as a Service) is one such model the companies are eyeing, to serve their purpose of effectively handling the continuous inward flow of diversified data and hosting them on cloud as PaaS provides this functionality.

- Big data Security:
Major threats as far as big data security is concerned are to the Data Mining solutions as they provide the strategic solutions to the business. Hence it becomes increasingly important to secure them against the security breaches caused by the fake users. There needs to be proper encryption of the authentication measures of the users. Also, it can be resolved with the use of metadata (data about data) as to who accessed what type of data and so on. The other prominent security issue with Big Data is of the distributed frameworks that are used for data storage purposes. Hadoop being one such open source big data platform where more systems can be prone to the security issues as the data processed is distributed over many distributed frameworks.

- Big data Analytics:
The analytics of big data consists of a lot of challenges as the inward flow of data is quite unstructured as it is from various connected devices like the sensors and websites. Hence the big data consists of three V’s; Volume – huge volumes of data sourced from sensors is to be analyzed. Variety – Data is unstructured and is in the form of 3d data, 2d data, log files etc. Velocity – the speed with which the data is processed which is nothing but real-time processing and continuous data processing. Hence, we see data complexity in Big Data Analytics.

-	Tools of big data:
In order to draw effective insights and inferences from the data, proper big data tools need to be in place. If the analysis of data is not done in a proper manner, then the efforts that are put into the collection of data from various data repositories and processing it through will be of no use. The commonly used Big Data tools are Apace Hadoop, Apache Hive, Storm, Cloudera, Qubole etc.

### Challenges:

The major challenges associated with the IoT are the security concerns with the increasing number of data sources & hence the distributed frameworks that might be needed to handle such huge data, connectivity related issues as the number of devices that are expected to be connected to the IoT is huge, what business models need to be used, compatibility issues because of the increasing technologies trying to become the standard going forward which will in turn increase the number of hardware and software devices being connected, reliability of data and fast data growth as a result of increasing number of connected devices [@fa18-523-59-www-iot-futureofiot], [@fa18-523-59-www-iot-challenesofiot].

### Applications:

The Internet of Things and Big Data are coming together plays and important role in commercial, industrial and other applications to offer better data sights and inferences. Some of the most common application are shown in the figure [@fa18-523-59-www-iot-intro].

![](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/fa18-523-71/blob/master/paper/images/IoT%20application.png)

- Application in Manufacturing Industries:
The machinery that is enabled with the Internet of Things (IoT) assist in transmitting operation related information to the managers which helps them identify the areas of optimization and the process of automation. It is also used in facilitative management of machine tools expected to function in specified ranges of temperature. Sensors enables by IoT can help monitor such machines sending alerts as soon as the sensor senses some deviation from the original specifications. Operating the machinery in the specified specification range in turn increases the efficiency of the operations, diminishes the downtime of the machines, helps reducing the costs and also helps in the conservation of the energy. The other application of IoT in the manufacturing domain is the Production Flow monitoring where the production lines monitoring is enabled from the refining to the packaging of the final products. If there is any discrepancy found in the operations, then the IoT enabled monitoring of the processes helps in adjusting them and managing them better from the cost of operation point of view, and avoiding wastes during the production process. Further, IoT helps in tracking and tracing the inventory across in the delivering of products on a global basis which helps the managers getting a clear idea of the supply chain process. We can ensure the safety of the workers in any given project by monitoring the performance indicators thereby reducing the injury rate and any relevant loss to the organization. IoT significantly helps in the quality control over the life cycle of the manufacturing process [@fa18-523-59-www-iot-applicationbenefits].

- Application in Health care:
The Internet of Things (IoT) has advanced its applications in the field of Healthcare a great deal right from monitoring remotely to getting accustomed to medication. It has served as a helping hand to the doctors with respect to living upto the expectations of the patients. The hospitals and started using Internet of Things (IoT) ensuring every patient gets the maximum benefits and stays healthier no matter how small the disease to be cured is. The IoT has guided the healthcare industry in improving the implementation of healthcare processes. Applications of IoT in various some of the healthcare areas is as under.

	IoT for managing inventory: There is a considerable amount of change in the way the hospitals have taken advantage of the IoT inventory management for the inventory control in the warehouses and the pharmacies.

	IoT for optimization of healthcare workflow – Adoption of wireless infrastructure have helped manage the throughput and perform an analysis of the existence of bottlenecks, if any, in the system and that we could get rid of the same.

	IoT for integrating the medical devices – Different ways are being looked at for integrating the devices like Fitbits with a view to obtain more data about the patient and be taken care of.  Neel Ganguly, vice president and CIO at JFK Health System in Edison, New Jersey mentioned of JFK Health System starting to use devices like blood pressure cuffs, glucometers etc with the intention of collecting data about the various signs of the patients which helped them serve the patients in a more effective manner.

	Just like IoT has security concerns in almost all of its extensive applications, the healthcare industry is no different.  But continuous efforts are being made to get rid of the existing barriers as well as the potential barriers. [@fa18-523-59-www-iot-iotinhealthcare]
    
### Use cases:
Now, IoT and Big data is everywhere. Due to the flexibility and scalability nature of big data, industries in the recent times have started adapting to the use of IoT. Some of the industrial use cases include,

- Caterpillar: An IoT pioneer – Caterpillar, one of the leading equipment makers is a perfect example of how it has reaped the benefits of using Internet of Things (IoT). They have eased out process of identification of levels of fuels for the personnel operating the machines and the timings of replacement of the air filters using the Internet of Things (IoT) along with Augmented Reality (AR) [@fa18-523-59-www-iot-usercasecaterpillar].

- IoT based Asset Tracking System in Transportation & Logistics – Number of assets were able to be tracked down by the existing tracking systems and the system use to breakdown reaching its threshold after the number of assets tracked increased exponentially. Since the devices used for tracking were from diversified manufacturers, it became increasingly difficult to analyze, draw inferences from the data and provide Business Intelligence reports. The solution to this was Internet of Things (IoT) which helped built a server for processing robust messaging. Geo-fencing was brought into implementation using IoT which would allow a trigger to be made on an asset entering or leaving a area. Also, an engine with respect to analytics was developed with a view to provide better data insights and meaningful Business Intelligence reports [@fa18-523-59-www-iot-industrialusecase].

- Smart metering using IoT – For measuring the consumption of gas, energy and water in buildings, a device capable of working with Internet called a smart meter is used. It has helped overcome the disadvantages of measuring just the overall consumption by allowing to record the level of consumption of each of the resources used thereby benefitting consumers monetary wise. In this way, Internet of Things (IoT) has helped improve the process of forecasting and binding the consumption of power [@fa18-523-59-www-iot-industrialusecase].

- Predictive Maintenance using IoT – Millions of dollars can be saved by the companies by keeping the equipment’s and assets going all the time with the help of sensors and data analytics thereby preventive maintenance  [@fa18-523-59-www-iot-industrialusecase].

### Future of IoT and Big Data

With data coming from disparate data sources and diversified connected devices, it has given the big data analysts option to distinguish and filter data and just process the useful chunks of data further to the data warehouses and then generate Business Intelligence reports from there on. With the emergence of IoT, it has become increasingly possible to reach out to the customers at any given time of the day. Devices like Fitbits and smart devices have made it possible for the doctors to get timely updates of the patient’s doing about his health thereby allowing the physicists to intervene whenever needed and provide mannerly treatment and diagnosis to their patients. Businesses have been reaping the benefits of the advancement in technology by having the luxury of digitally connecting to their clients even from the most remote locations in the world. In the years to come, the amalgam of the advancement in technology i.e. the Internet of Things, big data will give more likelihood to the businessmen in gathering even the most detailed information of their client and customers thereby giving themselves a better opportunity to improve their business from the perspective of effectively managing the monetary department and providing a better customer satisfaction which will invariably up their business a great deal [@fa18-523-59-www-iot-futureofiot].

### Conclusion

With time and the advancements in the field of IoT and big data, we have come to saying that they are nothing but two sides of the same coin. Why we say so is because Big Data and its analytics is all about data and this data is sourced from the many ‘connected devices’ that are connected to the IoT. The data volumes are expected to increase as and how the number of connected devices are to increase thus making the all aspects of life more digital.
